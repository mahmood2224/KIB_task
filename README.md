# KIP_task
this is flutter web project that implement simple crud operation showing layers of the code 
I used here 
- [sqflite as database] (https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite)

## Getting Started

this project is completing flutter task to show up my coding skills

### docker config 
to run this project and avoiding to install flutter sdk and init it i made docker file and image to do that instead
you should just download docker of the platform you working on (window, mac , links)
-[docker download for windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
-[docker download for mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
-[docker download for linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

note that if you run docker on windows you should allow linux sub system by running this command in windows power shell (you should run power shill as administrator)
-dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

After that you should install wsl from the link below 
-[wsl install and update](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi)
